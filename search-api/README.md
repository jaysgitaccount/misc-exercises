# Search API
I need to practice processing fetched data from APIs, so I'm using [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 

## Goals

- Maintainable, readable, testable code
- Must be efficient! No nested loops.

## Notes

One of the rules of the API is that users should locally cache any resources when making a request. So, I'll be learning to do caching for the first time, using the Cache API.

After finishing what I wanted to do, I learned a lot! My first time using `Promise.all()`, and also chaining multiple fetch requests to get the data I needed. I'm sure it's not the fastest code ever written, but I'm happy with what I wrote and I feel like it's quite tidy overall.
